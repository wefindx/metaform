If you can eradicate the taboo and shame around suicide, people are more likely to talk, to reach out for help. Knowing that people accept suicidality as a normal state makes a person less afraid or ashamed of connecting with others honestly. This connection in itself already reduces the risk of suicide. People tend to isolate themselves before killing themselves. We need to make suicide a normal topic and not have people hiding because they're feeling shit. We need them to connect, not disappear. \nAnd also, I would add that yes material issues are definitely a part of the suicide equation. People in poverty and people who experience massive losses suddenly, are all at higher risk depending on their support structures and their own psychological structure as well. E.g. during the Recession, suicides among certain demographics increased dramatically. People who'd been fairly wealthy and suddenly faced drastic losses were more likely to kill themselves. A huge shock to the system can cause suicidality in many people and that shock can be the grief of lost love, status disgrace or financial ruin. What's needed are ways to buffer against and absorb the shock. Some of these include solid social connections where honesty is safe. Sometimes, a chemical support such as a drug can buffer the shock in a short term sense but the person's autonomy needs to be able to resurface in order for full recovery.", "languages": ["en"], "created_date": "2019-09-11T12:37:32.445234", "donated": 0.0, "matched": 0.0, "claimed_hours": "0.00000000", "owner": {"username": "Niamhnab@7208D522", "id": 25}, "id": 748}, {"assumed_hours": "0.00000000", "remains": 0.0, "blockchain": 1, "topic": "https://api.infty.xyz/topics/74/?format=json", "url": "https://api.infty.xyz/comments/747/?format=json", "updated_date": "2019-09-11T12:29:43.013580", "parent": null, "text": ".:en\n[Hi@A517E17C] I think Patreon is potentially a good platform.
