# Metaform Documentation

Metaform [package](https://github.com/wefindx/metaform) provides a way to rename and normalize, transform and provide metadata for keys and values of recursively nested JSON-like data (which may have dictionaries and lists of dictionaries mixed in arbitrary ways) by providing a pattern to locate the keys to be modified or annotated.
